# caracas 1.1.0

* Global symbol assignment by `def_sym()` (#18)
* Linear algebra: New `do_la()` function with convinience functions like `eigenval()`, `eigenvec()`, `QRdecomposition()`. New vignette demonstrating these.
* Arbitrary precision arithmetic: `N()` function and vignette on 
  "Arbitrary precision arithmetic"
* Rename `eigen_val()`/`eigen_vec()` to `eigenval()`/`eigenvec()`
* More clear naming convention: R has expressions and caracas has symbols; 
  in this connection `as_r()` was renamed to `as_expr()` and 
  `as_symbol()` to `as_sym()`.
* Minor bugs fixed
