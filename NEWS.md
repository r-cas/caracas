# caracas 1.1.0

* Global symbol assignment by `def_sym()` (#18)
* Linear algebra: New `do_la()` function with convinience functions like `eigenval()`, `eigenvec()`, `QRdecomposition()`; new vignette demonstrating these
* Assumptions being made available, see e.g. `symbol()` and `ask()`
* Matrix symbols: `matrix_symbol()` together with helpers `sympy_declare()` and `inv_2x2()`
* Arbitrary precision arithmetic: `N()` function and vignette on 
  "Arbitrary precision arithmetic"
* Rename `eigen_val()`/`eigen_vec()` to `eigenval()`/`eigenvec()`
* More clear naming convention: R has expressions and caracas has symbols; 
  in this connection `as_r()` was renamed to `as_expr()` and 
  `as_symbol()` to `as_sym()`. Also, `as_sym()` changed argument from `declare_variables` to `declare_symbols`.
* Changed internals such that `der()`, `der2()` and `solve_sys()` now takes multiple variables with `list()` instead of `c()`; see also `matrify()`
* Minor bugs fixed
