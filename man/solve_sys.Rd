\title{Solves a system of non-linear equations}
\usage{
solve_sys(lhs, rhs, vars)
}
\arguments{
\item{lhs}{Equation (or equations as row vector/1xn matrix)}

\item{rhs}{Equation (or equations as row vector/1xn matrix)}

\item{vars}{vector of variable names or symbols}
}
\value{
A list with solutions (with class \code{caracas_solve_sys_sol}
for compact printing), each element containing a named
list of the variables' values.
}
\description{
If called as \code{solve_sys(lhs, vars)}
the roots are found.
If called as \code{solve_sys(lhs, rhs, vars)}
the solutions to \code{lhs = rhs} for \code{vars} are found.
